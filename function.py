#   Following is the manner in which we define function, the function is welcome_message()
#   The function code is indented and two lines gap is left just below the code
#   Functions are used to make code managable
#   To break code into smaller parts and reduce complexity in a place
#   Def is a keyword, short for define. Def basically tells python that we are defining a function
#   We should use meaningful descriptive words for functions

def welcome_message():
    print("Hello!")
    print("Welcome aboard.")

print("start")
welcome_message()   #   Calling the same function
print("end")
