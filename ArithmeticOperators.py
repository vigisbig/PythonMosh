                        # we can increment the value of x by 3 using following code

x = x + 3               # this updates the value of x to 13

x += 3                  # this is an alternative way of doing the above. this is called as augmented
                        # assignment operator.

x -= 3                  # this is an augmented assignment operator too which decreases the value by 3

x *= 3                  # works same way as above
