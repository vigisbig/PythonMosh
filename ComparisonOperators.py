x = 3 > 2       # 3 > 2, is a boolean expression. This will return a boolean value since it evaluates if
                # 3 > 2 and since it is true, the value True will be assigned to x



y = 3 >= 7
z = 7 <= 5
t = 5 == "5"    # this is an equality operator to check if values are equal
l = 5 == 5
u = 5 != 4       # this is inequality operator that checks for inequality and returns a boolean value

print(x,y,z,t,l,u)
