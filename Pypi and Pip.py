# Even though the standard Python library is comprehensive and has lot of modules, but it isn't complete by any means
# So, we have pypi - aka python package index.  In which there are 1000s of packages which we can use to build awesome things
# Pip is basically python package manager


# using the command line we installed open pyxl
# pip install openpyxl
