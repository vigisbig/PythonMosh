x = 10 + 3 * 2  # first multiplication is performed and then addition since it has higher precedence.

print(x)

y = (10+3)*2    # bracket can be used to change the operator precedence. The one is bracket is executed first
                # in this case

print(y)        # if you don't use brackets, the precedence is exponents, multiply or divide, addition or subtraction
